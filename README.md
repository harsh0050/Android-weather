**#Disclaimer:** Run the app on your android device rather than emulator if you could for better experience, since some features might not work on emulator.

**#Features**
1. Auto-Completion: You can enable suggestions, which will, as the name might suggest, help you autocomplete the name of cities, so that chances of making a typo is minimal.
2. Auto-Correction: As long as the spelling of location is somewhat appropriate, a small typo won't affect the searching (Auto Correct). (E.g. you can write "emztardeimn" instead of "amsterdam"
and still you'll get successful results)
  (I couldn't find any free correction api, so i made one myself. let me know if you want the REST api)
3. Current Location: If you hit the blue button besides the search bar, you can get the weather of your current location.

**P.S.** Instead of focusing on UI, I focused more on functionality and errors that a user could make.
